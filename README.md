# Design

## Colour Scheme

The color scheme for Software Stacks is designed to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Here's a detailed breakdown:

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - Colour Scheme for SoftawreStacks website
![Palette](documentation/screenshots/color_palette.JPG)
  
- **#003459 (Navy Blue)**: Used primarily in the `.dark-bg` class for navigation bars, footers, and certain buttons. This deep shade of blue conveys reliability and professionalism, anchoring the design with its strong presence.

- **#007EA7 (Teal)**: This vibrant shade is employed for hover states (`.custom-search-btn:hover`), links, and other interactive elements, adding a pop of color that invites user interaction. It also serves as the color for important buttons and links, guiding users' attention to key actions.

- **#00A8E8 (Deep Teal)**: Utilized for `.btn-signup` and `.btn-edit`, this color denotes actions and editable content, offering a visual cue to users about interactive elements.

- **#E84610 (Bright Red-Orange)**: Allocated for the `.btn-delete` class, this color acts as a warning or alert, indicating a potentially irreversible action, such as deleting content. It's designed to grab attention and prompt the user to proceed with caution.

- **#FFFFFF (White)** and **#00171F (Almost Black)**: These colors are used throughout the `.main-content` and text, ensuring excellent contrast and legibility. White backgrounds for cards and black text create a clean, modern look that's easy on the eyes.

- Additional accents like **#237dd1 (Bright Blue)** for the `.image-flash`, along with hover effects (`:hover` states) and specific icons (`.like-icon i, .bookmark-icon i`), enhance the website's interactive feel, using color to guide and inform user interactions.

This carefully chosen palette not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of Software Stacks but also supports usability and accessibility, making the platform welcoming and easy to navigate for all users.

## Fonts

For the **Software Stacks** project, the selection of fonts plays a crucial role in enhancing readability, ensuring accessibility, and contributing to the overall aesthetic of the application. Below is a detailed explanation of the fonts used in the project, along with their characteristics and reasons for selection.

### Google Fonts

**Software Stacks** utilizes fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), a library of free licensed font families, due to its wide variety of choices and easy integration into web projects. Here are the specific fonts used:

#### Roboto
- **Usage**: Primarily for body text.
- **Characteristics**: Modern, sans-serif. Offers great readability on digital screens. Designed with an open curve, making it accessible and friendly to users.
- **Reason for Selection**: Roboto is highly versatile, making it suitable for both body text and headings. Its clear and crisp lines ensure that the content is easy to read, enhancing user engagement.

[Roboto on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

#### Lato
- **Usage**: Headings and important callouts.
- **Characteristics**: Sans-serif. Features a mixture of curves and straight lines, providing a balance between professionalism and warmth.
- **Reason for Selection**: The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. This combination makes it perfect for drawing attention to section headings and important information.

# Project Planning

## Strategy Plane

**Project Overview:**  
Software Stacks aims to create a centralized platform where users can explore, learn, and interact with content related to various software development technologies. This includes front-end development, e-commerce solutions, and predictive analytics. The platform will serve as an educational hub, community forum, and resource center for both novice and experienced developers.

**Site Goals:**
- Provide a robust resource for learning and discussion around key software development topics.
- Foster a community of developers who can share insights, code snippets, and best practices.
- Maintain a user-friendly interface that caters to both desktop and mobile users, ensuring accessibility and ease of navigation.
- Enable scalable features that can evolve with technological advancements and user feedback.

## Agile Methodologies - Project Management:  
Software Stacks adopts Agile project management to ensure iterative development and continuous improvement. The use of GitHub Projects or similar tools will facilitate task management, tracking progress through a Kanban-style board.

### Story Points Allocation

**Story Points Distribution**
Story points were assigned to each user story to quantify the effort and complexity involved. These points helped us estimate the workload and prioritize our tasks effectively.

**Allocation Guidelines:**
- **Must-have Stories**: Essential features that are fundamental for the project's operations were given the highest priority.
- **Should-have Stories**: Important but not critical features that enhance the user experience without being essential to the core functionality. According to our project management guidelines, the total story points assigned to "Should-have" stories did not exceed 60% of the total points in any sprint. This ensured that essential features were developed first and resources were not overextended on less critical functionalities.
- **Could-have Stories**: Desirable features that were considered only after fulfilling the "Must-have" and "Should-have" categories.

### Sprint Planning Example
Here is an example of how story points are managed and allocated across different categories in sprints:

- **Total Story Points for the Sprint**: 100
- **Must-have Points**: 40 (40% of the total)
- **Should-have Points**: 50 (50% of the total)
- **Could-have Points**: 10 (10% of the total)

**Example Milestones:**
- **Milestone 1: Core Functionality**
  - Total Story Points: 60
  - Breakdown:
    - Must-have: 36 points
    - Should-have: 24 points
- **Milestone 2: Enhanced User Experience**
  - Total Story Points: 80
  - Breakdown:
    - Must-have: 32 points
    - Should-have: 48 points

### MoSCoW Prioritization: 
To effectively manage project scope, Software Stacks will implement the MoSCoW prioritization method:
- **Must Haves**: Core functionalities that include article browsing, user registration/login, and interactive forums.
- **Should Haves**: Enhanced features like user profiles, article bookmarking, and advanced search capabilities.
- **Could Haves**: Additional functionalities such as personalized learning paths, user badges for engagement, and API integrations for pulling in external content.
- **Won't Haves**: Features that are not essential for the initial launch phase, such as a full-fledged online course module or third-party advertising.

### User Stories, Milestones and Epics

### Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

I've used [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to design my site's ERD.

#### Database Schema

The Software Stacks application is structured on a robust database schema designed to facilitate the efficient organization and retrieval of data. Below is an overview of the database schema and the relationships between the different entities.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents the database schema of Software Stacks, detailing the system's tables, the data fields within them, and the relationships between the tables.

![ERD of Software Stacks](documentation/screenshots/erd.JPG)

#### Tables Overview

- **User**: Stores information about the users of the platform, including username, email, and password. The `is_staff` field indicates whether a user has administrative privileges.

- **Profile**: Contains extended user information such as name, join date, and bookmarks. This table extends the `User` table by associating profiles with user accounts.

- **Blog**: Central to the application, the `Blog` table holds data about blog posts including title, content, and metadata like creation date and whether the post is approved for public viewing.

- **Comment**: Enables the community aspect of the blog by storing user comments on blog posts. Each comment is linked to a specific post and user.

- **Category**: Categories allow for the organization of blog posts into topics, making it easier for users to find content related to specific subjects.

- **About**: This table likely contains static information about the application, such as the company's background, mission statement, and contact details.

- **Contact**: Presumably used for storing user inquiries submitted through the platform's contact form.

#### Relationships

- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Blog`, where one user can author many blog posts.
- A similar **one-to-many** relationship is set between `Blog` and `Comment`, allowing multiple comments to be associated with a single blog post.
- The `Profile` table has a **one-to-one** relationship with the `User` table, extending it with additional personal information.
- The `Category` table is linked to the `Blog` table in a **many-to-one** relationship, categorizing each blog post.
  
#### Design Considerations

The schema was designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that as the platform grows, new features and data types can be easily incorporated. For example, the separation of the `User` and `Profile` tables allows for flexible user management and the possibility to include additional user attributes in the future without altering the core user authentication system.

### Security

Security is a critical aspect, especially for a platform like Software Stacks that handles user-generated content and personal data.

#### Data Encryption
- All sensitive data, including user passwords and personal information, are encrypted using robust encryption methods to protect against unauthorized access and breaches.

#### CSRF Tokens
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens are included in every form to help authenticate the request with the server when the form is submitted. Absence of these tokens can leave a site vulnerable to attackers who may steal a users data.

#### AllAuth  

- Django AllAuth is an installable framework that takes care of the user registration and authentication process. Authentication was needed to determine when a user was registered or unregistered and it controlled what content was accessible on **SoftwareStacks**

# Deployment

The deployment process for Software Stacks involves multiple platforms including GitHub, Gitpod, Heroku, ElephantSQL, and Cloudinary. Here's how each part fits into the deployment process:
Below are the respective URLs for the platforms and services used in deploying and managing the Software Stacks application:

## GitHub
- **Repository Setup:** Initially, a GitHub repository is created to host all project code and documentation. This repository is the central hub for version control and collaboration.
[GitHub](https://github.com)

## Gitpod
- **Development Environment:** Gitpod is used as a cloud-based IDE for writing, running, and debugging the code. It is directly integrated with GitHub, allowing seamless pulls and pushes to the repository. [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

## Heroku
- **Application Hosting:** Heroku is used to deploy the live application. It is connected to the GitHub repository for continuous deployment. Every push to the main branch triggers a deployment process.
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
  - **Setting up on Heroku:**
    1. Create a new app on Heroku.
    2. Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository.
    3. Set up Config Vars in Heroku including `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_URL`, `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`, 	1 (this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment) etc.
    4. Deploy the main branch using the Heroku dashboard or enable automatic deployments for every push to the main branch.
    5. 
**For deployment Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.**
- requirements.txt
- Procfile
  
You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:

- **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- **pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt**

**The Procfile can be created with the following command:**

echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
replace app_name with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located

## ElephantSQL
- **Database Hosting:** ElephantSQL provides a PostgreSQL database service, which is used by the Django application. The `DATABASE_URL` from ElephantSQL is set in the Heroku config vars to connect the application to the database. 

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: tribe).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

## Cloudinary
- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary is used for hosting media files like images. It removes the load of serving static files from Heroku, ensuring better performance and scalability. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)
  - **Integration:**
    1. Set up a Cloudinary account.
    2. Configure the Cloudinary settings in the Django settings file with the API keys provided by Cloudinary.
    3. Use Djangoâ€™s storage backend for Cloudinary to handle media uploads.
