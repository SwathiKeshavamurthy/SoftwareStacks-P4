# Colour Scheme

The color scheme for Software Stacks is designed to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Here's a detailed breakdown:

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - Colour Scheme for SoftawreStacks website
![Palette](documentation/screenshots/color_palette.JPG)
  
- **#003459 (Navy Blue)**: Used primarily in the `.dark-bg` class for navigation bars, footers, and certain buttons. This deep shade of blue conveys reliability and professionalism, anchoring the design with its strong presence.

- **#007EA7 (Teal)**: This vibrant shade is employed for hover states (`.custom-search-btn:hover`), links, and other interactive elements, adding a pop of color that invites user interaction. It also serves as the color for important buttons and links, guiding users' attention to key actions.

- **#00A8E8 (Deep Teal)**: Utilized for `.btn-signup` and `.btn-edit`, this color denotes actions and editable content, offering a visual cue to users about interactive elements.

- **#E84610 (Bright Red-Orange)**: Allocated for the `.btn-delete` class, this color acts as a warning or alert, indicating a potentially irreversible action, such as deleting content. It's designed to grab attention and prompt the user to proceed with caution.

- **#FFFFFF (White)** and **#00171F (Almost Black)**: These colors are used throughout the `.main-content` and text, ensuring excellent contrast and legibility. White backgrounds for cards and black text create a clean, modern look that's easy on the eyes.

- Additional accents like **#237dd1 (Bright Blue)** for the `.image-flash`, along with hover effects (`:hover` states) and specific icons (`.like-icon i, .bookmark-icon i`), enhance the website's interactive feel, using color to guide and inform user interactions.

This carefully chosen palette not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of Software Stacks but also supports usability and accessibility, making the platform welcoming and easy to navigate for all users.

# Fonts

For the **Software Stacks** project, the selection of fonts plays a crucial role in enhancing readability, ensuring accessibility, and contributing to the overall aesthetic of the application. Below is a detailed explanation of the fonts used in the project, along with their characteristics and reasons for selection.

### Google Fonts

**Software Stacks** utilizes fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), a library of free licensed font families, due to its wide variety of choices and easy integration into web projects. Here are the specific fonts used:

#### Roboto
- **Usage**: Primarily for body text.
- **Characteristics**: Modern, sans-serif. Offers great readability on digital screens. Designed with an open curve, making it accessible and friendly to users.
- **Reason for Selection**: Roboto is highly versatile, making it suitable for both body text and headings. Its clear and crisp lines ensure that the content is easy to read, enhancing user engagement.

[Roboto on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

#### Lato
- **Usage**: Headings and important callouts.
- **Characteristics**: Sans-serif. Features a mixture of curves and straight lines, providing a balance between professionalism and warmth.
- **Reason for Selection**: The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness. This combination makes it perfect for drawing attention to section headings and important information.

**A milestone,** represents a significant checkpoint or goal in a project's timeline. Milestones are used to signify the completion of a key phase of work, the achievement of a major objective, or the meeting of a significant deadline. They are critical for tracking progress, setting deadlines, and aligning the team and stakeholders around key project events or achievements. Unlike tasks or user stories, milestones don't involve work themselves but are markers indicating that a specific set of work has been completed.

## Epics

**An epic** in software development and project management is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or stories, often referred to as user stories. Epics are used to organize related tasks that contribute toward a significant, unified objective within a project. They help teams to focus on bigger-picture goals and ensure that all the smaller tasks (user stories) are aligned towards achieving that overarching aim. Epics typically span across multiple sprints or iterations and can take several weeks or months to complete.

# Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

I've used [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to design my site's ERD.

### Database Schema

The Software Stacks application is structured on a robust database schema designed to facilitate the efficient organization and retrieval of data. Below is an overview of the database schema and the relationships between the different entities.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents the database schema of Software Stacks, detailing the system's tables, the data fields within them, and the relationships between the tables.

![ERD of Software Stacks](documentation/screenshots/erd.JPG)

#### Tables Overview

- **User**: Stores information about the users of the platform, including username, email, and password. The `is_staff` field indicates whether a user has administrative privileges.

- **Profile**: Contains extended user information such as name, join date, and bookmarks. This table extends the `User` table by associating profiles with user accounts.

- **Blog**: Central to the application, the `Blog` table holds data about blog posts including title, content, and metadata like creation date and whether the post is approved for public viewing.

- **Comment**: Enables the community aspect of the blog by storing user comments on blog posts. Each comment is linked to a specific post and user.

- **Category**: Categories allow for the organization of blog posts into topics, making it easier for users to find content related to specific subjects.

- **About**: This table likely contains static information about the application, such as the company's background, mission statement, and contact details.

- **Contact**: Presumably used for storing user inquiries submitted through the platform's contact form.

#### Relationships

- A **one-to-many** relationship exists between `User` and `Blog`, where one user can author many blog posts.
- A similar **one-to-many** relationship is set between `Blog` and `Comment`, allowing multiple comments to be associated with a single blog post.
- The `Profile` table has a **one-to-one** relationship with the `User` table, extending it with additional personal information.
- The `Category` table is linked to the `Blog` table in a **many-to-one** relationship, categorizing each blog post.
  
#### Design Considerations

The schema was designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that as the platform grows, new features and data types can be easily incorporated. For example, the separation of the `User` and `Profile` tables allows for flexible user management and the possibility to include additional user attributes in the future without altering the core user authentication system.

**CSRF Tokens** 

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens are included in every form to help authenticate the request with the server when the form is submitted. Absence of these tokens can leave a site vulnerable to attackers who may steal a users data.

**AllAuth**  

Django AllAuth is an installable framework that takes care of the user registration and authentication process. Authentication was needed to determine when a user was registered or unregistered and it controlled what content was accessible on **SoftwareStacks**
